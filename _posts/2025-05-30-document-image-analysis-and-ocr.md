## Overview  
In this project, I focused on **document image analysis** and **optical character recognition (OCR)** using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The goal was to build a pipeline capable of automatically detecting, segmenting, and extracting both **Persian** and **English** text from real-world document images.

## Object Detection with YOLO  
To locate regions of interest (such as license plates, chassis numbers, or postal codes), I trained a **YOLO-based detection model** on a custom dataset.

## OCR with PaddleOCR  
After detection, I fine-tuned the **PaddleOCR recognition model** to support both **Persian** and **English**. This step allowed the system to extract accurate text from the cropped image regions.

## Key Contributions  
- Developed a **two-stage pipeline** combining **object detection** and **OCR recognition**.  
- Fine-tuned OCR for **bilingual text recognition (Persian & English)**.  
- Achieved robust performance on **structured document fields** such as vehicle details and postal codes.
