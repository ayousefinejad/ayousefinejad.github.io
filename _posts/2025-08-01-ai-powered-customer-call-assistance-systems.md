Our team typically needs to contact customers by phone an average of 5 to 6 times throughout each sales process. This high volume of communication led us to ask: can we make this process shorter and smarter?

This question set us on a clear path: automating customer calls to increase efficiency ðŸš€ and enhance the customer experience ðŸŒŸ.

In recent weeks, we successfully integrated our internal systems with Google Voice, enabling automated calls to customers. This step marks the beginning of reducing repetitive tasks for our team and allowing us to focus more on creating value for our clients.

Our goal is to soon bring this solution into full production, making the call process completely intelligent and seamless.

Currently, we are exploring three main approaches:

- Using speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules, though these often introduce a few seconds of response delay.
- Converting speech to text and using pre-recorded, categorized audio responses, which requires matching each text to the appropriate reply.
- Leveraging Googleâ€™s new Voice-to-Voice models for more natural and immediate interactions.

We tested the last approach, and the video below demonstrates the results
